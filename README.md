# JPA Project
An application that allows the user to add contacts, record close contacts between those contacts and find close contacts. This project reads from files and parses that data into an array. I will remake this project with data persisting in a database at a later date.

Code architecture follows MCV paradigm and implements the serializable interface.

Features:

 â—¾ Sort find results by Name/Date

Example of recording a close contact between 2 contacts. Will be updated to persist objects in a database in the future.
